# Sales-Data-Task-2
This was a little complex for me, but i kept going. 
It was a little more than just the simple pandas functions i was used to, and i'm not even done
But we continue tomorrow :)

UPDATE!
I FINISHED ITTT!
It kind of felt like a herculean task, but i found a way.
You know how tech people always say " there's more than one way to write code"
WELL! lol i found my own way! 

UPDATE on the UPDATE!
I have included the visualization of all the data extracted from the Sales DataFrame.
:)
